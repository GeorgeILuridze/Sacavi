    <h2>Charles Brandt</h2>
    <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
    <p>I owe a debt of gratitude to my incredibly beautiful, talented, and wonderful<br>
        wife, Nancy, who gave each chapter and each revision a hard, honest, and<br>
        sensible edit before I sent it to the publisher. While I was in New York and<br>
        Philadelphia working on the book Nancy took care of everything else and<br>
        gave me daily inspiration, encouragement, and support. On the times Nancy<br>
        would accompany me to visit Frank Sheeran, he would light up like a<br>
        young man. And I owe a deep sense of gratitude for the encouragement of<br>
        our supportive children Tripp Wier, Mimi Wier, and Jenny Rose Brandt.<br>
        I owe a debt of gratitude to my remarkable mother, who at 89, cooked<br>
        Italian food for me, put up with me, and encouraged me during the long<br>
        weeks I stayed in her Manhattan apartment and sat at my laptop.<br>
        I owe a debt of gratitude to my dear friend, the publishing icon William<br>
        G. Thompson—first to publish both Stephen King and John Grisham—who<br>
        generously lent his expertise as editorial advisor in developing and<br>
        executing the project.<br>
        I struck pay dirt when Frank Weimann of the Literary Group agreed to be<br>
        my agent. Frank took the project to heart as a piece of history that would<br>
        otherwise be lost, gave the book its title, and gave Frank Sheeran a nudge in<br>
        the right direction for his final taped interview.<br>
        A special thanks to the talented Kristin Sperber, editor at Steerforth, who,<br>
        among other things, caught me writing like a lawyer from time to time.<br>
        When Neil Reshen suggested that my agent contact Steerforth Press we<br>
        suddenly had my book accepted by a publisher who is always thinking.<br>
        Thank you Neil, for steering us to the exceptional Chip Fleischer and his<br>
        aide, Helga Schmidt.<br>
        Thanks to those writers, such as Dan Moldea, Steven Brill, Victor Riesel,<br>
        and Jonathon Kwitny, whose skillful investigative reporting, at risk of<br>
        physical harm, uncovered and preserved so much of the history of Jimmy<br>
        Hoffa, his times, and his disappearance.<br>
        Thank you to those agents, investigators, and prosecuting attorneys and<br>
        their staff whose efforts created many of the headlines and news stories I<br>
        consulted.<br>
        Thanks to my creative cousin, Carmine Zozzora, for his daily<br>
        encouragement that kept me focused when the going was rough and for his<br>
        wise counsel every bit of the way, especially when I would bellyache and he<br>
        would repeat: “Just write the book; the rest will take care of itself.”<br>
        A big heap of gratitude to all my superb friends and family who rooted<br>
        for this book, and to those pals to whom I repeatedly turned for advice,<br>
        encouragement, and support, especially Marty Shafran, Peter Bosch, Steve<br>
        Simmons, Leo Murray, Gary Goldsmith, Barbara Penna, Rosemary<br>
        Kowalski, Jeff Weiner, Tracy Bay, Chris DeCarufel, Jan Miller, Theo Gund,<br>
        and Molly and Mike Ward. I owe a deep debt in countless ways to Rob<br>
        Sutcliffe.<br>
        Thanks Lynn Shafran for all your advice, and especially for bringing the<br>
        late Ted Feury to Nancy and me. Thank you, Ted, so much.<br>
        Thanks to the award-winning illustrator, author, and artist, my friend Uri<br>
        Shulevitz, who more than twenty years ago encouraged me to start writing<br>
        professionally.<br>
        And a belated thanks to my inspiring eleventh-grade English teacher at<br>
        Stuyvesant High School in 1957, Edwin Herbst.</p>
